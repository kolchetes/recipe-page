## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive HTML

### What I learned

I learned how to use tables in HTML, I had a hard time using them.

### Continued development

I want to learn mobile-first designs, also I want to make my next websites with more accessibility and more semantic HTML. 

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools HTML Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) - This helped me a lot when making the "nutrition section" table
